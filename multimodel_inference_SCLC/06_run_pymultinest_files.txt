Now that the run_model_[model_number]_[dataset].py files have been generated for all candidate
models, can run PyMultinest. Can run multiple run_model files on multiple cores or by using a
computer cluster, or choose to run one at a time. Scripts 07a-c and 09 expect these files to
be in a directory Bayes-MMI/pymultinest_results/, so when calling run_model_[model_number]_[dataset].py,
include pymultinest_results/ as the first argument in the call.
